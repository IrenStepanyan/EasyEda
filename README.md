# Raspberry Pi 3B+ MCP3008 Potentiometer and LED Control

This project reads an analog value from a potentiometer using the MCP3008 ADC and a Raspberry Pi 3B+, and optionally controls an LED based on the potentiometer reading.

## Components Used
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- MCP3008 (10-bit ADC)
- Potentiometer (10kΩ)
- LED + 330Ω Resistor (optional)
- Breadboard & jumper wires

## Circuit Schematic
The schematic was designed in **EasyEDA**.

## Python Code
- Will be added soon
- Reads analog values from the potentiometer using MCP3008.
- Optionally turns an LED on if the potentiometer value crosses a threshold.
